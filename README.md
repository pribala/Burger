### Overview

   - Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users      input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

   - Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app      displays the burger on the left side of the page        waiting to be devoured.

   - Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour       it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger         moves to the right side of the page.

   The app stores every burger in a database, whether      devoured or not.


   The app follows the MVC design pattern. It uses Node    and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to    generate the HTML.
